     Possible data issues
       The type for column MaintenanceAmount in table [ROM].[Rooms] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed to  DECIMAL
         (10, 2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with
         type  DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL.
       The type for column RentAmount in table [ROM].[Rooms] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed to  DECIMAL (10,
         2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible with type 
         DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL.
       The column [ROM].[TenantRoomDetails].[ExitApproved] on table [ROM].[TenantRoomDetails] must be added, but the column has
         no default value and does not allow NULL values. If the table contains data, the ALTER script will not work. To avoid
         this issue you must either: add a default value to the column, mark it as allowing NULL values, or enable the generation
         of smart-defaults as a deployment option.
       The type for column AdvancePaidDate in table [ROM].[TenantRoomDetails] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed
         to  DATETIME NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible
         with type  DATETIME NOT NULL.
       The type for column AdvancePendingAmount in table [ROM].[TenantRoomDetails] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being
         changed to  DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is
         incompatible with type  DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL.
       The type for column PowerAmount in table [TRX].[TransactionAmount] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible
         with type  DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL.
       The type for column PreviousAmount in table [TRX].[TransactionAmount] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed to
          DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is
         incompatible with type  DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL.
       The type for column WaterAmount in table [TRX].[TransactionAmount] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible
         with type  DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL.
       The type for column PendingAmount in table [TRX].[TransactionBills] is currently  INT NOT NULL but is being changed to
